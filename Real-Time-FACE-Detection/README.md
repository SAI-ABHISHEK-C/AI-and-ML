🔹 **Featured Project: Real-Time Emotion, Age, and Gender Detection**

Description
This project uses DeepFace and OpenCV to create a real-time application that:

- Detects emotions, age, and gender directly from a webcam feed.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces with annotated information.
- Displays the dominant emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad), approximate age, and gender in real-time.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: DeepFace, OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas

🖼️ Sample Output

The application detects and displays:

Age: e.g., Age: 25
Gender: e.g., Man or Woman
Dominant Emotion: e.g., Happy, Sad

🛠️ Future Enhancements

- Add support for multiple languages in the labels.
- Integrate face recognition for personalized outputs.
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning the detection models.
